    // Return the default logger. In general, you should use the default logger. You can also create
    // your own loggers and use them with QPDF and QPDFJob objects, but there are few reasons to do
    // so. One reason may be that you are using multiple QPDF or QPDFJob objects in different
    // threads and want to capture output and errors to different streams. (Note that a single QPDF
    // or QPDFJob can't be safely used from multiple threads, but it is safe to use separate QPDF
    // and QPDFJob objects on separate threads.) Another possible reason would be if you are writing
    // an application that uses the qpdf library directly and qpdf is also used by a downstream
    // library or if you are using qpdf from a library and don't want to interfere with potential
    // uses of qpdf by other libraries or applications.
    QPDF_DLL
    static std::shared_ptr<QPDFLogger> defaultLogger();

    // Defaults:
    //
    // info -- if save is standard output, standard error, else standard output
    // warn -- whatever error points to
    // error -- standard error
    // save -- undefined unless set
    //
    // "info" is used for diagnostic messages, verbose messages, and progress messages. "warn" is
    // used for warnings. "error" is used for errors. "save" is used for saving output -- see below.
    //
    // On deletion, finish() is called for the standard output and standard error pipelines, which
    // flushes output. If you supply any custom pipelines, you must call finish() on them yourself.
    // Note that calling finish is not needed for string, stdio, or ostream pipelines.
    //
    // NOTES ABOUT THE SAVE PIPELINE
    //
    // The save pipeline is used by QPDFJob when some kind of binary output is being saved. This
    // includes saving attachments and stream data and also includes when the output file is
    // standard output. If you want to grab that output, you can call setSave. See
    // examples/qpdfjob-save-attachment.cc and examples/qpdfjob-c-save-attachment.c.
    //
    // You should never set the save pipeline to the same destination as something else. Doing so
    // will corrupt your save output. If you want to save to standard output, use the method
    // saveToStandardOutput(). In addition to setting the save pipeline, that does the following
    // extra things:
    //
    // * If standard output has been used, a logic error is thrown
    // * If info is set to standard output at the time of the set save call, it is switched to
    //   standard error.
    //
    // This is not a guarantee. You can still mess this up in ways that are not checked. Here are a
    // few examples:
    //
    // * Don't set any pipeline to standard output *after* passing it to setSave()
    // * Don't use a separate mechanism to write stdout/stderr other than
    //   QPDFLogger::standardOutput()
    // * Don't set anything to the same custom pipeline that save is set to.
    //
    // Just be sure that if you change pipelines around, you should avoid having the save pipeline
    // also be used for any other purpose. The special case for saving to standard output allows you
    // to call saveToStandardOutput() early without having to worry about the info pipeline.
