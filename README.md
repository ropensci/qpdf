Content-preserving transformations transformations of PDF files such as split, combine, and compress. This package interfaces directly to the 'qpdf' C++ API and does not require any command line utilities. Note that 'qpdf' does not read actual content from PDF files: to extract text and data you need the 'pdftools' package.
